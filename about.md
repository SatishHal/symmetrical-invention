I am an IT Support and Service Desk Analyst with 8+ years of progressive experience supporting enterprise users across Microsoft 365, Entra ID (Azure AD), Active Directory, and endpoint management platforms.

I have a strong background in Tier 1–Tier 2 technical support, providing reliable, user-focused assistance in fast-paced enterprise environments. My experience includes supporting 500+ end users, resolving Windows 10/11, Microsoft 365, VPN, and network connectivity issues while consistently meeting SLA and customer satisfaction targets.

I specialize in endpoint and identity operations, including:

User account provisioning and access management in Active Directory and Entra ID

MFA troubleshooting, onboarding, and offboarding

Device provisioning and lifecycle management using Microsoft Intune, Autopilot, SCCM, KACE SMA, and MDT

Secure access implementation through Intune Conditional Access and Endpoint Security policies

I have hands-on experience implementing device compliance, BitLocker encryption, endpoint security baselines, and Conditional Access controls to ensure that only compliant and authorized devices can access corporate resources. My work balances strong security controls with a smooth end-user experience.

Throughout my career, I have contributed to improving first-contact resolution, documentation quality, and operational efficiency by maintaining knowledge base articles, standard operating procedures, and automation workflows.

Currently based in Toronto, Canada, I bring a security-first, operations-focused mindset, strong communication skills, and a continuous improvement approach to enterprise IT support and endpoint security operations.

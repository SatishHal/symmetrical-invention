I am a  IT Support and Endpoint Security professional based in Canada, with over **7 years of hands-on experience** supporting enterprise environments across **Microsoft 365, Entra ID (Azure AD), Intune, and Windows platforms**.

I focus on building secure, compliant, and scalable device access solutions rather than only resolving individual issues.

My work centers around Microsoft Intune, Conditional Access, and Endpoint Security policies to ensure only authorized and compliant devices can access corporate resources.

I bring a security-first, operations-focused mindset with strong documentation and clear communication.
